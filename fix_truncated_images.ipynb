    "One image in the `image_paths` folder is truncated. This will cause an error in PyTorch's dataloaders. One easy fix is to set `LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True`. However, this only works when `num_workers = 0`, which can lead to low GPU usage during training as the CPU doesn't keep up with the GPU. \n",

    "The code below tries to open all images with `LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = False` and save them to a temporary file. When this fails for a truncated image, we set `LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True`,  adding a small black border, and we resave the image to its original path. Thereafter we can set `num_workers > 0` in our dataloaders and enjoy optimal GPU utilization. "
